What is tweaked between the original repo
========================================

For some reason ,and I don't know why, the original source is not working correctly on Cordova (since `codova v6.1.1` and `android v5.0`),
so I am trying to make some adjustments to allow contents to be viewable on the real mobile devices.

Why Even Bother?
========================================
I know all examples in this repo is developed with the old man `version 0.5 of Polymer`, but the concept and the form of this app is really a `nice UI showcase and power display for Polymer`. And all result `UI and features in version 0.5 can also be found in 1.0`, only there are a lot enhancements in 1.0 (tell me about it). Also, if some one wants to take a look about `how's the performance of Polymer works on Cordova/Mobile`, then this is the right place for you.
